## SystemLess AdBlock
A simple ad blocker based on the hosts file. \
The project is designed for use in KernelSu, but it can be used easily in Magisk and APatch.

The hosts file weighs approximately 33 mb, so there is a lot blocked. \
I left some sites unblocked, like Google Api, Facebook, Music App and Samsung stuff... \
If you have any suggestions for unlocking something that is not futile, let me know and I will do it.

The file will be updated every week.
